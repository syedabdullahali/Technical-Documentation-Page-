        Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend

          making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and
           western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi),
            is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa,

        When you think of Canada, you might conjure up images of a sprawling landmass,
        a maple leaf flag, and feet upon feet of snow. While all of these things 
        are Canadian,
        the country is much more than a large piece of land with a tree leaf flag and harsh winters.
        So what is Canada known for?
        Canada is known for its diverse culture, unwaveringly polite people,
         maple syrup, poutine, and ice hockey.
        Many famous Hollywood entertainers are Canadian natives. In addition,
        Canada is world-renowned for its varied wildlife and breathtaking natural scenery.

            India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),
            [24] is a country in South Asia.
             It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, 
             and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, 
             the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, 
             it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China,
             Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east.
              In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives;
               its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, 
               Myanmar and Indonesia.

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no 
later than 55,000 years ago.[25][26][27] Their long occupation, 
initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, 
has made the region highly diverse,
 second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[28] Settled life emerged on the 
 subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, 
 evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE

    India is known for many, many different aspects – its food, culture, 
    its massive population, its natural landscapes, its languages, classical dances,
     Bollywood or the Hindi film industry (famous Indian figures such as Amitabh Bachchan,
      Shahrukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai), 
    the birthplace of yoga, spirituality, natural beauty,\
     its warm, welcoming citizens… the list can go on. 

The country has something for everyone. Torn between beaches and mountains? India has both.
 You can partake in adventurous white-water rafting, 
 or indulge in a tranquil paddle in a lake; ride a camel in a desert in Rajasthan or huddle
  beneath a blanket while you gaze at the stars in Ladakh.

It might sound cliche but it’s true: India is not a country.
 It’s an experience — an experience I guarantee you will not have anywhere else in this world.
  It is charming, chaotic, peaceful, bustling, tolerant, welcoming, open, 
  friendly and proud, all at the same time. 
  It’s a potpourri of sugar, spice and everything nice!
